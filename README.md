# Multi Filter Face Detection Camera

A real-time video processing application that captures video from a camera, applies various image processing operations, and outputs the processed video to a virtual camera for use in applications like Zoom, Discord, or OBS Studio.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a Computer Vision course at Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt. It demonstrates real-time image processing capabilities including statistical analysis, filtering operations, and face recognition.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality
- **Real-time video capture** from physical camera using OpenCV
- **Virtual camera output** using pyvirtualcam for integration with video conferencing apps
- **Live histogram visualization** with RGB channel analysis
- **Interactive controls** for switching between different processing modes

#### Transformations & Filters:
- **Linear Transformation** - Contrast and brightness adjustment
- **Histogram Equalization** - Automatic contrast enhancement
- **Edge Detection** - Sobel filter for edge highlighting
- **Gaussian Blur** - Smoothing filter
- **Sharpen Filter** - Detail enhancement
- **Gabor Filter** - Texture analysis and pattern detection

### Special Feature - Face Recognition
- **Face identification** with known faces from image database
- **Privacy protection** with automatic face blurring for unknown individuals
- **Visual indicators** with bounding boxes and name labels

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- OBS Studio (for virtual camera functionality)
- Compatible webcam

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rohanraaj2/Virtual-Camera.git
   cd Virtual-Camera
   ```

2. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Setup face recognition (optional):**
   - Add face images to the `images/` directory
   - Supported formats: .jpg, .png
   - Name files as "PersonName.jpg" for automatic recognition

4. **Install OBS Studio:**
   - Download from [https://obsproject.com](https://obsproject.com)
   - Install virtual camera plugin if needed

## üéÆ Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
python run.py
```

### Interactive Controls

| Key | Function |
|-----|----------|
| `1` | Original image (no filter) |
| `2` | Linear transformation |
| `3` | Histogram equalization |
| `4` | Edge detection |
| `5` | Gaussian blur |
| `6` | Sharpen filter |
